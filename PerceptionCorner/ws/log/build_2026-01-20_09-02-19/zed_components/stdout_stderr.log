[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:139 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcob_srvs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "cob_srvs",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cob_srvs" with any
  of the following names:

    cob_srvsConfig.cmake
    cob_srvs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cob_srvs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cob_srvs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cob_srvs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
